madlib = f"He sensed a {noun} drifting thorugh the basement. Soundless and {adjective}. \
{verb} up the stairs, taking them two at a time, landing heavily with each step. \
Crash, a board cracked, and Liam {verb2}, slamming his shin hard against the wood. \
He grabbed the top step, catching himself before he fell. He wheezed, \
felt dizzy, woozy, Liam's {adjective2} leg dangled in the air, kicking \
at nothingness. He felt a thin, {adverb} grip around his ankle. \
Like a claw pulling, dragging him down. Liam yanked his leg free, \
lifted himself up, gasping for air, and {verb3} to the top of the stairs. \
He crawled into the {noun2}, into the light. He slammd the door shut \
behind him, twisted the lock, heart thundering."
